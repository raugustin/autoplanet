# Autoplanet
Secure coding tutorial - based on MVC procedural PHP web app

## Background info
As security professional I was involved with website security testing, reporting vulnerabilities to web developers and verifying if these were properly fixed. As I was interested in how vulnerabilities can get into web applications and how to prevent them I thought the best way to find out is making (secure) websites myself. Therefore I started two projects: autoworld and autoplanet. Both are car trading websites, based on PHP and MySQL: Users can sell cars (after signing in) and can search and buy cars. Autoworld was written from scratch with no plan, little knowledge of programming and therefore full of vulnerabilities. Autoplanet is the second project and an attempt to do a better job by using MVC architecture, code design priciples (dry, kiss, yagni, name conventions, etc.) and secure coding practices. As I hadn't any experience with OOP both sites were programmed in procedural PHP, to my opinion this shouldn't be an issue as you can write good and secure sites also in procedural programming.

## Security Architecture
### Data Integrity Controls
* Input sanitization: Remove/replace/escape/encode unwanted input  
* Input validation: Reject unwanted input
* Prepared Statements: Prevent that user data can alter your SQL queries
* File upload security: Donâ€™t allow users to upload and execute whatever they want
* Output encoding: Convert data into a safe format before sending it to the user

Where to put the data integrity controls in the MVC
### Data Access Controls
* Web page access: Check authorization upon every page request - has the user the right role to access this web page ?
* Data object access: Make sure that only authorized users can execute actions on data objects (e.g. delete records)
* Centralize access control: Use a centralized authorization routine - copying the same authorization code on every page is error prone
* Session data access: Prevent unauthorized access to session ID's and cookies
* Database access: Use database accounts for each user role with corresponding authorizations based on least privilege principle
